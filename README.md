# COMP3340_Project

Course Project Topic: Image Classification on Oxford 17 Flowers Dataset Using Convolutional Neural Network

Main Contribution: Investigated the performance of EfficientNet on Oxford 17 Flowers Dataset

The full implementation is presented in the report pdf file.

1. Run python split_aug.py (Data Augmentation)
2. This will generate 64 original images and 64 augmented images to flower/train, and 8 images to flower/val and flower/test
3. Run the 4 model python files 


To open tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir runs
